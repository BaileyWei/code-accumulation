Some weights of BertForPreTraining were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /data/wjb/pretrained_weight/bert-base-japanese and are newly initialized: ['cls.predictions.decoder.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
